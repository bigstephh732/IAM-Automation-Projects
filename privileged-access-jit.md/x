## Privileged Access Automation – Just-In-Time (JIT) Administrative Access

🎯 Goal
Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) administrative access using Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to eliminate standing privileged roles and enforce time-bound elevation.
🧠 Objective
Remove permanent administrative access
Enforce MFA during privilege activation
Require business justification
Limit elevation duration
Generate audit logs for compliance
This project demonstrates enterprise-grade privilege control aligned with Zero Trust principles.
🏗️ Architecture Overview
Identity Platform: Microsoft Entra ID
Feature Used: Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
Role Configured: User Administrator
Access Model: Eligible → Activated (Time-Bound)
Access Flow:
User assigned Eligible role
User activates role when needed
MFA + justification required
Role active temporarily
Role expires automatically
Audit logs record activation
⚙️ Configuration Steps
Step 1 – Assign Eligible Role
Navigated to: Identity Governance → PIM → Roles
Selected: User Administrator
Assigned role to: lab-admin
Assignment type: Eligible
Duration: Permanent
At this stage, no administrative permissions were granted.
Step 2 – Configure Role Settings
Configured the following activation controls:
Require MFA on activation → Enabled
Require justification → Enabled
Maximum activation duration → 1 hour
Approval requirement → Disabled (lab simplicity)
This ensures controlled elevation.
Step 3 – Activate Role
Signed in as lab-admin
Navigated to: PIM → My Roles
Selected: User Administrator
Clicked Activate
Provided justification:
“Temporary elevation required to manage user accounts and perform directory administration.”
Completed MFA challenge
Activated role for 1 hour
Step 4 – Validate Activation
Confirmed role appears under:
PIM → My Roles → Active
Expiration timestamp visible.
Step 5 – Review Audit Logs
Reviewed:
PIM → Audit History
Verified:
Activation event
User identity
Timestamp
Justification
MFA enforcement
Audit logging confirms accountability and traceability.
🔄 Automation Behavior
This configuration ensures:
No permanent privileged access
Privileges only exist during activation window
Automatic expiration removes elevated rights
All activation events are logged
No manual cleanup required.
🛡️ Security Impact
Eliminates standing administrative access
Reduces attack surface
Prevents privilege abuse
Enforces multi-factor authentication at elevation
Creates compliance-ready audit trails
This aligns with Zero Trust and least privilege principles.
📚 Key IAM Concepts Demonstrated
Eligible vs Active role assignments
Just-In-Time privilege elevation
MFA enforcement at privilege boundary
Time-bound access control
Audit logging and accountability
Least Privilege
💬 Interview Talking Points
Implemented JIT administrative access using PIM
Converted standing admin access to eligible assignments
Enforced MFA and justification during activation
Limited elevation duration to reduce risk
Validated activation audit logging
🏁 Summary
This project demonstrates practical implementation of privileged access automation using Microsoft Entra ID. By replacing permanent administrative access with controlled, time-bound elevation, the risk of privilege abuse is significantly reduced while maintaining operational flexibility.
