## Lifecycle Automation – Time-Bound Access (Entitlement Management)


### Goal
Implement automated lifecycle-based access control using Microsoft Entra Entitlement Management to grant time-bound access and automatically remove permissions upon expiration.


### Objective
Automate access provisioning  
Enforce time-limited access  
Automatically remove access on expiration  
Demonstrate governance-driven IAM model  


### Architecture Overview
Components Used:
Security Group: IAM-Project-Access
Catalog: IAM-Automation-Catalog
Access Package: Time-Bound-Project-Access
Assignment Policy: 7-Day Expiration
Access Flow:
User requests access
System grants access automatically
Expiration timestamp assigned
Access automatically removed after 7 days
No manual intervention required.


### Configuration Steps
Step 1 – Created Security Group
Created:
IAM-Project-Access
Used as resource granted by access package.
Step 2 – Created Catalog
Created:
IAM-Automation-Catalog
Added IAM-Project-Access as a resource.
Step 3 – Created Access Package
Created:
Time-Bound-Project-Access
Added resource role:
IAM-Project-Access
Member
Step 4 – Configured Assignment Policy
Configured:
Users in directory may request
No approval required
Access duration = 7 days
Expire access
Remove access automatically
This enforces lifecycle automation.


### Validation & Testing
Test 1 – Request Access
User:
lab-user1
Requested access via:
https://myaccess.microsoft.com
Access granted automatically.
Test 2 – Verify Assignment
Verified:
Assignment status = Delivered
Expiration date assigned
Confirmed user added to IAM-Project-Access group.
Test 3 – Lifecycle Logic Confirmation
Reviewed assignment record:
Start date
Expiration date
Removal configured
This confirms lifecycle-based access control.


### Automation Behavior
The system automatically:  
Provisions group membership  
Sets expiration timestamp  
Removes access after expiration  
Maintains audit records  
No administrator cleanup required.  


### Security Impact
Prevents access creep.  
Reduces forgotten permissions.  
Enforces least privilege.  
Automates onboarding/offboarding.  
Supports audit and compliance requirements.  


### IAM Concepts Demonstrated
Entitlement Management  
Access Packages  
Assignment Policies  
Time-bound access  
Automatic removal  
Governance-based access control  


### Summary
This project demonstrates automated lifecycle management of access using Microsoft Entra ID. Time-bound access policies were implemented to reduce risk associated with long-term permissions while maintaining operational efficiency.
